# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This website uses HTML and JavaScript to create a weather forecast. This forecast shows the current weather in whatever city you search up. It will also display the forecast for the next five days of that city underneath the current weather. The website displays the weather forecast by using data that is taken from the oepn weather API. The first API used is a geocoder that gets the coordinates of the city and then sends those coordinates to the one call API which stores the weather data. The data is then displayed to the screen using jQuery by pulling the data out of the API objects. The cities entered are saved to local storage which displays the cities looked up previously in a button under the search bar every time the page reloads. You can click these buttons to display the city's forecast again.
